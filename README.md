# Overview of the Functionality
For this assignment, we will build two GUI programs for a Chat Program (Client and Server), a Networking support library (used by both), and a file logger class.  
The file logger class project called "FileLogger" (ASP Core Console Library) contains three class files: a custom logger file, a custom log provider file, and an extension method file.
The extension method appends the current time and thread whenver we log an event.
CustomFileLogger sends logging information about our program 
CustomFileLogProvider is a wrapper class for the CustomFileLogger and manages the Services of our program.

# Comments to Evaluators:

We tried our best to implement according to the API but we were very confused with TCP and networking in general. And trying to implement it in a way where MVC made sense was 
difficult.

# Consulted Peers:

We consulted each other as partners.


# Partnership:

So far, all work has been done during pair programming! We met over Zoom and worked together on this assignment throughout.

# Branches:

No branches at this time.

# Best Team Practices:

We were able to give each other ideas and help each other write code while pair programming. We also were able to switch off who was the typer
and who was the helper each day that we worked on the assignment. This helped us not get too burnt when programming and would help the other 
partner take the lead so that we could get a different perspective each day we worked. This helped us program better and not get stuck on certain 
implementation ideas or certain issues. Switching perspectives was quite helpful. We did not really assign tasks since we did pair programming the entire time.

To improve our teamwork, we can do better to be more efficient so that we can get done in time for future assignments. We want to be able to get better at
communicating so that we can get things done sooner. Other than that we worked well together. We were able to meet often and were able to both write good code.
